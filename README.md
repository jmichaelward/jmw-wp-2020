# About this repository
Not only have I been running my [personal website](https://jmichaelward.com) on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) for 
years, but I've also been a user and advocate of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) for just about as long. 
Though I've integrated Composer usage into my professional years ago, I've failed to bring that knowledge and structure 
to my own site.

This repository attempts to correct that omission.
